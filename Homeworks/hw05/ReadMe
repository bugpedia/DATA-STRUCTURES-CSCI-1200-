HOMEWORK 5: LINKED TRAIN CARS
	In this assignment we examine and manipulate a doubly-linked list structure 
	of different types of train cars:
		engines, freight cars, passenger cars, dining cars, and sleeping cars.
	Each engine weighs 150 tons and has power = 3,000 horsepower, freight cars
	hold different weights (depending on the contents of the car), and all other 
	cars weigh 50 tons. Note that a train can have multiple engines that work 
	together to drive the train, and these engines can be positioned 
	at the front, the back, or even in the middle of the train! 
	Your task for this assignment is to perform a variety of basic train yard operations
	to connect, disconnect, and reconnect cars into trains in preparation for service.

ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  13 hours



DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SHIPFREIGHT ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimal (fastest train speed, most freight, fewest number
of engines used, and fewest resulting trains) for any input.  Note:
Student choice on how to prioritze between these goals.  Describe your
priorization and your implementation.



DESCRIPTION OF IMPROVED SEPARATE ALGORITHM FOR EXTRA CREDIT 
Aiming for optimally comfortable trains (smaller values for average
distance to dining and/or larger values for closest engine to sleeper)
and/or handling cases with > 2 engines.  Student choice on how to
prioritze between these goals.  Describe your priorization and your
implementation.
